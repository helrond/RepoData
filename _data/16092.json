Located on the lower level of the Bishop Payne Library, the archives houses the Seminary\u2019s collection of records, manuscripts, photographs, recordings, and other written materials of unique value.\n\nThe Archives serves as the official repository for the records of both the Virginia Theological Seminary and the former Bishop Payne Divinity School. The Archives collects a wide range of manuscripts and personal papers of alumni, professors, officers, and other individuals connected with either seminary. To further document the founding, development, and influence of these seminaries, the Archives also collects records and personal papers of persons and institutions of the Diocese of Virginia.\n\nSince 2003, the Archives has been the home of the African American Episcopal Historical Collection, a joint project with the Historical Society of the Episcopal Church to document the experience of African Americans in the life and ministry of the Episcopal Church.", "Longitude": null, "Name Notes": null, "Entry Recorded By": "Whitney Ray", "Source of Repository Data": "SAA@CUA", "Repository Type": "Religious", "Date Entry Recorded": "2018-03-04 00:00:00", "Repository Name Authorized": null, "URL of Source of Repository Data": "https://saaatcua.wordpress.com/map/"}
