Since its founding in 1869 the Corcoran has educated thousands of fine arts students, held nearly 2,000 exhibitions, presented innovative programs for adults and children, commissioned two important works of architecture, and been the scene of some of Washington's most glamorous events. The records documenting these activities also provide a unique picture of how private museums have operated from the 19th century to modern times.", "Longitude": null, "Name Notes": null, "Entry Recorded By": "Whitney Ray", "Source of Repository Data": "SAA@CUA", "Repository Type": "College/University", "Date Entry Recorded": "2018-03-04 00:00:00", "Repository Name Authorized": null, "URL of Source of Repository Data": "https://saaatcua.wordpress.com/map/"}
