Moorland, a Black theologian who was an alumnus and trustee of the University, donated his private library, at that time considered one of the most significant collections of Black related materials in existence. Dr. Moorland\u2018s donation reflected the efforts of African Americans to take a leadership role in the documentation, preservation, and study of their own history and culture. His collection provided the catalyst for the centralization of the University Library\u2018s other Black related materials, which became known collectively as the Moorland Foundation. In 1946 Howard University acquired the large personal library of Arthur B. Spingarn, an attorney,social activist, and prominent collector of books and other materials produced by Black people.The Moorland-Spingarn Research Center is named for these two benefactors whose collections provided the foundation upon which later development could be built.", "Longitude": null, "Name Notes": "Founders Library", "Entry Recorded By": "Whitney Ray", "Source of Repository Data": "SAA@CUA", "Repository Type": "College/University", "Date Entry Recorded": "2018-03-04 00:00:00", "Repository Name Authorized": null, "URL of Source of Repository Data": "https://saaatcua.wordpress.com/map/"}
