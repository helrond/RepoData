However some sources contain information on North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, and other states throughout the United States. More limited resources are available for some foreign countries. In general, the more people a state has contributed to Georgia, the more materials we will have on that state. We offer county histories; family histories; limited indexes to wills, deeds, military rosters, passenger lists, and other documents; and Atlanta city directories. Census records for Georgia 1820 through 1880, and 1900 through 1930 are available on microfilm, as well as local histories and a collection of Georgia newspapers. We do not hold vital records such as birth and death certificates.
