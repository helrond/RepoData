Freeman Eighth Air Force Research Center at the Mighty Eighth Air Force Museum encompasses a research library with over 9,000 volumes, a manuscript and photographic collection, an oral history collection, and an artifact collection. Highlights of these collections include original diaries and letters as well as over 28,000 previously unpublished photographs, over 1,000 personal accounts most of which are unpublished written by 8th Air Force veterans, over eighty hand-painted leather flight jackets and the Medals of Honor awarded to William R. Lawley, Jr. and Forrest L. Vosler. Since a complete roster of World War II 8th Air Force veterans has never existed, the research center is compiling its own list known as the Veterans Database with the help of veterans and their families. The Roger A. Freeman Eighth Air Force Research Center is dedicated to promoting research on 8th Air Force history and to expanding this priceless collection.", "Longitude": null, "Name Notes": null, "Entry Recorded By": "Whitney Ray", "Source of Repository Data": "Georgia Historical Records Advisory Council", "Repository Type": "Historical Society/Museum", "Date Entry Recorded": "2018-03-10 00:00:00", "Repository Name Authorized": null, "URL of Source of Repository Data": null}
